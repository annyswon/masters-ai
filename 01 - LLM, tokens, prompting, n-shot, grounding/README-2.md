## **Key Concepts: What are AI and ML?**

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI aims to replicate human intelligence in tasks such as language understanding and decision-making.

- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI, ML involves training algorithms to learn from data, enabling tasks like image classification and regression.

## **What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?**

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, generate human-like responses by processing vast amounts of text data.

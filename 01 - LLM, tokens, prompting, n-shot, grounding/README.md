# README - Generative AI Training Journey

Welcome to the official repository for the Generative AI Training course! This course aims to provide a deep dive into key AI concepts, including machine learning (ML), neural networks, and large language models (LLMs). Below, you'll find details about the course structure, expectations, and illustrations to enhance your learning experience.

## **Course Introduction and Structure**

The course begins with a comprehensive overview of AI and progresses through essential topics. Here is the course outline:

1. **AI and Machine Learning Overview**
2. **Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)**
3. **Python and API Integration for AI Tasks**
4. **Image Generation and Working with Audio**
5. **AI Ethics and Security in Enterprises**
6. **Capstone Project**

## **Key Concepts: What are AI and ML?**

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI aims to replicate human intelligence in tasks such as language understanding and decision-making.

- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI, ML involves training algorithms to learn from data, enabling tasks like image classification and regression.

## **What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?**

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, generate human-like responses by processing vast amounts of text data.
